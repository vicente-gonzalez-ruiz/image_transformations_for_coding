\section{Insights}\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Signals can be represented at least in two different domains: the
  signal domain (for example, time in the case of sound of space in the
  case of image) and the frequency domain (in general, in a transform
  domain).
\item
  Transform coding is based on the idea that, in the transform domain,
  most of the energy of the signal can be compacted in a small number of
  (transform) coefficients.
\item
  This property can be interesting for increasing the coding efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section{Basic coding steps}
\subsection{Encoder}
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Split \(s\) into blocks of \(B\) samples, if required.
\item
  Transform each block.
\item
  (Optional) Quantize the coefficients.
\item
  Lossless encode the quantized coefficients, performing a minimal
  bit-allocation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Decoder}
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Decode the coefficients of each block.
\item
  (Optional) ``Dequantize'' the coefficients of each block.
\item
  Inverse-transform each block.
\item
  Join the blocks, if required.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Splitting}
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Divide \(s=\{s_n\}_{n=0}^{N-1}\) into \(\lceil N/B \rceil\) blocks
  \(\{c_1, \cdots, c_{\lceil N/B \rceil}\}\) of \(B\) samples.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Transform of a block}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the forward transform the samples of the block are correlated with
  (the block is compared to) a set of basis functions

  \begin{equation}
    \{C_u\}_{u=0}^{B-1} = \sum_{n=0}^{B-1}a_{u,n}c_n.
    \tag{forward\_transform}
  \end{equation}
\item
  The backward (inverse) transform restores the original samples

  \begin{equation}
    \{c_n\}_{n=0}^{B-1} = \sum_{u=0}^{B-1}b_{n,u}C_u.
    \tag{inverse\_transform}
  \end{equation}
\item
  These equations can be written in matrix form as

  \begin{equation}
    C=Ac
    \tag{forward\_transform\_matrix\_form}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    c=BC,
    \tag{inverse\_transform\_matrix\_form}
  \end{equation}

  where \(A\) and \(B\) are matrices, being
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{l}
    [A]_{u,n} = a_{u,n} \\\relax
    [B]_{n,u} = b_{n,u}.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation}

\item
  In transform coding, \(A\) and \(B\) must be inverses of each other
  (\(B=A^{-1}\)), i.e.

  \begin{equation}
    AB = BA = I,
  \end{equation}

  where \(I\) is the identity matrix.
\end{itemize}

\section{A color transform}
\subsection{Luminance and chrominance}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance}{Chrominance} (or
  chroma) is the signal used in video systems to convey the color
  information of the picture or a video. It was defined to add the color
  signal to the black and white one in analog TV. Thus, the same signal,
  composed by two different subsignals: Y and UV that can be isolated by
  filtering, was compatible with both, black and white (which only used
  Y) and color ones (that used
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV}{YUV}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        \text{Y}\\
        \text{U}\\
        \text{V}
      \end{array}
    \right) =
    \left(
      \begin{array}{rrr}
          0,299 & 0,587 & 0,144 \\
          -0.14713 & -0.28886 &  0.436 \\
          0.615   & -0.51499 & -0.10001
      \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        \text{R}\\
        \text{G}\\
        \text{B}
      \end{array}
    \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        \text{R}\\
        \text{G}\\
        \text{B}
      \end{array}
    \right) =
    \left(
      \begin{array}{rrr}
          1 &  0       &  1.13983 \\
          1 & -0.39465 & -0.58060 \\
          1 &  2.03211 &  0
      \end{array}
    \right)
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        \text{Y}\\
        \text{U}\\
        \text{V}
      \end{array}
    \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Later, in digital video, the YUV color domain was called the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr}{YCrCb color domain}.
\item
  Used, for example, in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG}{JPEG}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spectral (color) redundancy}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model}{\(\text{RGB}\)
  domain} is more redundant than the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV}{\(\text{YUV}\) domain}:
\end{itemize}

\section{Chrominance subsampling}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling}{The human visual
system is more sensitive to the luma (Y) than to the chroma (UV)}. This
means than the chroma can be subsampled without a significant loss of
quality in the images.

\section{Orthogonal transform}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The rows of \(A\) (\(a_{k,*}\)) are refered to as the \emph{basis
  vectors} of the transform, and should form an \emph{orthogonal} basis
  set in order to provide maximum energy compactation. The rows can be
  also seen as the coefficients of \(B\) filters, being the first one
  (\(i=0\)) the ``low-pass'' one, which will produce the DC coefficient,
  and the rest (\(i\geq 1\)) the ``high-pass'' filters, which will
  generate the AC (Alternating Current) coeffs. These \(B\) filters form
  a filter-bank where the overlapping between the frequency response of
  the filters should be as small as possible if we want maximum energy
  compaction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Orthonormal transform}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  If the basis vectors of a orthogonal transform are unit vectors, the
  transform is said orthonormal.
\item
  For orthonormal transforms, it holds that

  \begin{equation}
    A^{-1} = A^T.
  \end{equation}

  Therefore, the pair of transforms refered by Eqs.
  (forward\_transform\_matrix\_form) and
  (inverse\_transform\_matrix\_form) can be written as

  \begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{l}
      C=Ac \\
      c=A^TC.
    \end{array}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Signal energy}
\begin{equation}
  ||s||^2 = \sum_{n=0}^{B-1}s_n^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Energy conservation}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  if \(A\) is orthonormal (also called \emph{unitary}), the energy of
  the transformed signal is the equal to the original one:

  \begin{equation}
     ||C||^2 = ||c||^2.
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proof}
\begin{equation}
  ||C||^2 = C^TC = (Ac)^TAc = c^TA^TAc = c^TIc = c^Tc = ||c||^2.
\end{equation}

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value}{Expected value}}
The expected value \(\operatorname{E}[X]\) of a random variable \(X\),
intuitively, is the long-run average value of repetitions of the
experiment it represents. Let \(X\) be a random variable with a finite
number of finite outcomes \(X_1\), \(X_2\), \(\cdots\), \(X_n\)
occurring with probabilities \(p_1\), \(p_2\), \(\cdots\), \(p_k\),
respectively. The expected value (or \emph{expectation}) of \(X\) is
defined as

\begin{equation}
  \operatorname{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n X_ip_i.
\end{equation}

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance}{Variance}}
The variance of a random variable \(X\) is the expected value of the
squared deviation from the mean of \(X\):

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_X=\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}\left[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])^2 \right] = \operatorname{E}\left[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])(X - \operatorname{E}[X]) \right] = \operatorname{E}\left[X^2 \right] - \operatorname{E}[X]^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance}{Covariance}}
The covariance \(\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)\) is a measure of the joint
variability of two random variables \(X\), \(Y\), defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \operatorname{cov}(X,Y) = \operatorname{E}{\big[(X - \operatorname{E}[X])(Y - \operatorname{E}[Y])\big]},
\end{equation}

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix}{Covariance
matrix}}
A covariance matrix \(\Sigma_Z\) is a matrix whose element in the \(i\),
\(j\) position is the covariance between the \(i\)-th and \(j\)-th
elements of a random vector \(Z\) (a collection of random variables
\(Z_i\)):

\begin{equation}
  \Sigma_Z =
    \begin{bmatrix}
       \operatorname{E}[(Z_1 - \mu_1)(Z_1 - \mu_1)] & \operatorname{E}[(Z_1 - \mu_1)(Z_2 - \mu_2)] & \cdots & \operatorname{E}[(Z_1 - \mu_1)(Z_n - \mu_n)] \\ \\
       \operatorname{E}[(Z_2 - \mu_2)(Z_1 - \mu_1)] & \operatorname{E}[(Z_2 - \mu_2)(Z_2 - \mu_2)] & \cdots & \operatorname{E}[(Z_2 - \mu_2)(Z_n - \mu_n)] \\ \\
       \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \\
       \operatorname{E}[(Z_n - \mu_n)(Z_1 - \mu_1)] & \operatorname{E}[(Z_n - \mu_n)(Z_2 - \mu_2)] & \cdots & \operatorname{E}[(Z_n - \mu_n)(Z_n - \mu_n)]
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \operatorname{E}
    \left[
       (Z - \operatorname{E}[Z])
       (Z - \operatorname{E}[Z])^{\rm T}
    \right].
\end{equation} where \begin{equation}
  \mu_i = \operatorname{E}(Z_i),
\end{equation} is the expected value of the \(i\)-th entry in the vector
\(Z\).

\section{Covariance matrix of a block-based transform}
\begin{equation}
  \Sigma_S = \operatorname{E} \left[
       (S - \operatorname{E}[S])
       (S - \operatorname{E}[S])^{\rm T}
    \right] = \operatorname{E} \left[
       A(s - \operatorname{E}[s])
       (s - \operatorname{E}[s])^{\rm T}A^{\rm T}
    \right] = 
    A \operatorname{E} \left[
       (s - \operatorname{E}[s])
       (s - \operatorname{E}[s])^{\rm T}
    \right] A^{\rm T} = 
    A\Sigma_sA^{\rm T}.
\end{equation}

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence}{Correlation}}
The most familiar measure of dependence between two random variables
\(X\) and \(Y\) is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient,
or ``Pearson's correlation coefficient'', commonly called simply ``the
correlation coefficient''. It is obtained by dividing the covariance of
the two variables by the product of their standard deviations.

\begin{equation}
  \rho_{X,Y}=\mathrm{corr}(X,Y)={\mathrm{cov}(X,Y) \over \sigma_X \sigma_Y} ={\operatorname{E}[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)] \over \sigma_X\sigma_Y}
\end{equation}

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation}{Autocorrelation}}
Autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is the correlation of
a signal \(s[t]\) with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay
\(s[t+\tau]\).

\begin{equation}
  \rho_s[\tau]=\rho_{s[t],s[t+\tau]}={\operatorname{E}[(s[t]-\mu)(s[t+\tau]-\mu)] \over \sigma^2}
\end{equation}

where \(\mu=\operatorname{E}(s[t])=\operatorname{E}(s[t+\tau])\) and
\(\sigma=\sigma_{s[t]}=\sigma_{s[t+\tau]}\).

\section{Autocorrelation matrix}
The autocorrelation matrix of a random process \(X\) is the matrix
\([R]\) defined by

\begin{equation}
  [R]_{i,j} = \rho_X[|i-j|].
\end{equation}

\section{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors}{Eigenvalue and eigenvector}}
In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector
\(\overrightarrow{v}\) of a linear transformation \(T()\) is a non-zero
vector that changes by only a scalar factor \(\lambda\) (known as the
eigenvalue, characteristic value, or characteristic root of
\(\overrightarrow{v}\)) when that linear transformation is applied to
it:

\begin{equation}
  {\displaystyle T(\overrightarrow{v} )=\lambda \overrightarrow{v}}.
\end{equation}

When \(T()\) can be expressed by a matrix \(X\), we get

\begin{equation}
  A\overrightarrow{v} =\lambda \overrightarrow{v}.
\end{equation}

\section{Coding gain}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  The coding gain measures the compaction level of the transform, which
  is defined as

  \begin{equation}
    G=\frac{\frac{1}{B}\displaystyle\sum_{u=0}^{B-1}\sigma_{C_u}^2}{\sqrt[B]{\displaystyle\prod_{u=0}^{B-1}\sigma_{C_u}^2}},
  \end{equation}

  where \(\sigma_{C_u}^2\) is the variance of coeff \(C_u\).
\end{itemize}

\section{Karhunen-Loéve transform (KLT)}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  For the KLT, the rows of \(A\) (the basis of the forward transform)
  are the eigenvectors of the (unnormalized) autocorrelation matrix
  \([R]\) of the signal \(s\), where

  \begin{equation}
    [R]_{i,j} = \operatorname{E}\big(s_ns_{n+|i-j|}\big).
  \end{equation}
\item
  It can be proven that KLT minimizes
  \(\sqrt[B]{\prod_{u=0}^{B-1}\sigma_{C_u}^2}\), and therefore, it
  provides the maximum coding gain. Unfortunately, the basis fuctions of
  the KLT depends on \(s\). If \(S\) is
  non-\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process}{stationary},
  the autocorrelation matrix (or the basis) must be sent to the decoder
  (to run the inverse transform) as side information. However, if
  \(B=2\), the KLT is

  \begin{equation}
    A_{\text{2-KLT}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    \left[
      \begin{array}{cc}
        1 & 1 \\
        1 & -1
      \end{array}
    \right]
  \end{equation}

  for all signals.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discrete cosine transform (DCT))}
\hypertarget{definition}{%
\subsubsection{Definition}\label{definition}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The forward (direct) transform is

  \begin{equation}
    S_u = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{N}}
    K(u)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n\cos\frac{(2n+1)\pi u}{2n},
  \end{equation}

  and the backward (inverse) transform is

  \begin{equation}
    s_n = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{N}}
    \sum_{u=0}^{N-1} K(u)S_u\cos\frac{(2n+1)\pi u}{2n},
  \end{equation}

  where \(N\) is the number of pixels, and \(s_n\) denotes the \(n\)-th
  pixel of the image \(s\), and

  \begin{equation}
    K(u) =
    \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \text{si}~u=0\\
        1 & \text{if}~u>0.
      \end{array}
      \right.
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Properties fo DCT}
\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Separable}: the \(D\)-dimensional DCT can be computed using
  the \(1\)D DCT in each possible dimension.
\item
  In general, \textbf{high energy compaction}: a small number of DCT
  coefficients can reconstruct with a reasonable accuracy the original
  signal.
\item
  \textbf{Unitary}: the energy of the DCT coefficients is proportional
  to the energy of the samples.
\item
  \textbf{Orthonormality}: DCT basis are orthonormal (orthogonal +
  unitary) and therefore, DCT coefficients are uncorrelated.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Dyadic discrete wavelet transform (DWT)}
Key features:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{High spectral compaction}, specially when transient signals
  are present.
\item
  \textbf{Multiresolution representation}: it is easy to recover a
  reduced version of the original image if only a sub-set of the
  coefficients is proccesed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Filters bank implementation}
Where: \begin{equation}
  s = (\uparrow^2(L)*{\text s}_L) + (\uparrow^2(H)*{\text s}_H)
\end{equation} and \begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    L & = & \downarrow^2(s*{\text a}_L) \\
    H & = & \downarrow^2(s*{\text a}_H).
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

Comments:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \({\text a}_L\) and \({\text a}_H\) are the transfer function (the
  transfer function of a filter is the response of that filter to the
  unitary impulse function (Dirac's delta)) of a low-pass filter and
  high-pass filter, respectively, that have been designed to be
  complementary (ideally, in \(L\) we only found the frequencies of
  \(s\) that are not in \(H\), and viceversa). When this is true, it is
  said the we are using a perfect-reconstruction quadrature-mirror
  filter-bank and the DWT is \emph{biorthogonal}.
\item
  In the wavelet theory, \({\text s}_L\) is named the \emph{scale
  function} and \({\text s}_H\) the \emph{mother function} or
  \emph{wavelet basis function}. The coefficients of \(L\) are also
  known as the \emph{scale coeffients} and the coeffcientes of \(H\) the
  \emph{wavelet coefficients}~\cite{sovic2012signal}.
\item
  \(\downarrow^2(\cdot)\) and \(\uparrow^2(\cdot)\) donote the
  subsampling and oversampling operations:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
    (\downarrow^2(s))_i = s_{2i}
  \end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
    (\uparrow^2(s))_i =
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    s_{i/2} & \text{if $i$ if even} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \end{equation}

where \(s_i\) if the \(i\)-th sample of \(s\).

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item
  \(*\) is the convolution operator.
\item
  Notice that half of the filtered samples are wasted.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lifting implementation~\cite{sweldens1997building}}
Comments:

\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
  L_i = s_{2i} + \{{\cal U}(H)\}_i

\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Subsampled signals \(\{s_{2i}\}\) and \(\{s_{2i+1}\}\) can been

\end{equation*}

and

\begin{equation*}
   \{s_{2i}\} = \downarrow^2(s),
\end{equation*}

where \(Z^{-1}\) represents the one sample delay function.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}

\item
  \(H\) has tipically less energy and variance and entropy than
  \(\{s_{2i+1}\}\).
\item
  \(L\) has less aliasing than \(\{s_{2i}\}\) (notice that \(L\) has not
  been low-pass filtered before subsampling it).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The one-dimensional (1D) DWT is a separable transform. Therefore, the
  2D DWT can be computed applying the DWT to all the rows of an image
  and next, to all the columns, or viceversa.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The contribution of a coefficient of a subband \(b\) is determined by
  the DWT basis fuction \({s_H}^b\) asociated to that coefficient, which
  can be empirically determined by applying the inverse DWT to the Dirac
  Impulse function localized in that coefficient (notice that
  \({s_H}^b\) does not depend on the coefficient because we are
  supposing that all the coefficients of a subband have the same
  contribution, the same basis fuction)

\begin{equation}
  E({{\text s}_H}^b) = \sum_i{|{{\text s}_H}^b_i|}^2.

In the case of the 5/3-DWT, the L\(_2\)-norms of the DWT subbands are:

The \(i\)-th sample of the low-frequency subband is computed (using a
filter plus subsampling) as

\begin{equation}
  L_i=\frac{s_{2i}+s_{2i+1}}{2},
  \tag{HaarL}
  \label{eq:Haar_A-LPF}
\end{equation}

and the \(i\)-th sample of the high-frequency subband as

\begin{equation}

\begin{equation}
  L_i=s_{2i}+\frac{H_i}{2}.

  \label{eq:Haar_A-LPF-lifting}
\end{equation}

Notice that \(H_i=0\) if \(s_{2i+1}=s_{2i}\), therefore, the Haar
transform is good to encode constant signals. The notation X/Y indicates
the length (taps or number of coefficients) of the low-pass and the
high-pass (convolution) filters of the filter bank implementation (not
Lifting), respectively.

The \(i\)-th sample of the low-frequency subband (using a filter-bank
implementation) is

\begin{equation}
  L_i=-\frac{1}{8}s_{2i-2}+\frac{1}{4}s_{2i-1}+\frac{3}{4}s_{2i}
  +\frac{1}{4}s_{2i+1}-\frac{1}{8}s_{2i+2}
  \tag{5/3L}
  \label{eq:Lineal_A-LPF}
\end{equation}

and the \(i\)-th sample of the high-frequency signal is computed by

\begin{equation}
  H_i=s_{2i+1}-\frac{s_{2i}+s_{2i+2}}{2},
  \tag{5/3H}
  \label{eq:Lineal_A-HPF}
\end{equation}

that, if we use Lifting, it can be also computed using less operations
by

\begin{equation}
  L_i=s_{2i}+\frac{H_{i-1}+H_i}{4}.
  \tag{5/3LLifted}
  \label{eq:Lineal_A-LPF_lifting}
\end{equation}

Notice that \(H_i=0\) if \(s_{2i+1}=(s_{2i}+s_{2i+2})/2\). Therefore,
the 5/3 transform is suitable to encode lineally piece-wised signals.

  In lossless coding, coeffs \(S_u\) are directly encoded using some
  text compression algorithm or a combination of them.
\item
  However, in most situations, a lossy compression is needed and in this
  case, a transform coder must determine, given a maximum number of bits
  \(\overline{R}\) (which is defined by the compression ratio selected
  by the user), the number of bits \(R(u)\) used by the quantizer for
  each coeff \(S_k\).

\tightlist
\item
  In unitary transforms, as a consequence of the energy preserving
  property, an uniform quantization (i.e.~the dividing each coeff
  \(S_u\) by the same quantization step) should provide optimal bit
  allocation if we want to minimize the quantization error (the
  distortion) in the recostructed signal \(s\).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lets assume that the variance of the coeffs, defined as

  \begin{equation}
    \sigma_{S_u}^2 = \text{E}\big( (S_u - \overline{S})^2\big)

  (where

  \begin{equation}
     \overline{S} = \text{E}(S) = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{u=0}^{B-1} S_u

  Therefore, coeffs with high variance should be assigned more bits and
  viceversa.

  as the (target) average number of bits/coeff, where \(R(u)\) is the
  number of bits assigned to coeff \(S_u\).

  If the mean square error is as a measure of distortion, the variance
  of the distortion generated by the quantization of a coeff \(S_u\)

    \begin{itemize}
\item
  Assuming an additive distorion metric, the total distortion variance
  for \(R_k\) bits/coeff is given by

  \begin{equation}
    D = \sigma_{S-\tilde{S}}^2 = \sum_{u=0}^{B-1} \sigma_{S_u-\tilde{S}_u}^2 = \sum_{u=0}^{B-1}\alpha_u 2^{-2R(u)}\sigma_{S_u}^2 = \alpha\sum_{u=0}^{B-1}2^{-2R(u)}\sigma_{S_u}^2
    \tag{$D$}
  \end{equation},

  supposing that \(\alpha_u = \alpha\) is constant for all coeffs (a
  valid supposition for unitary transforms because the quantization
  error generated in each coeff should be the same if an uniform
  quantizer is used).
\item
  The objective of the bit-allocation process is to find the
  \(\{R(u)\}_{u=0}^{B-1}\) so that minimize \(D\) subject to constraint
  \(\overline{R}\):

  \begin{equation}
    \underset{\{R(u)\}_{u=0}^{B-1}}{\operatorname{arg min}} D, \text{s.t.}~{\overline{R}}. 
  \end{equation}
\item
  This is an optimization problem that can be solved using
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier}{Lagrange
  multipliers} (note: the following development is not the ``standard''
  way of using Lagrenge multipliear, but it is equivalent).
\item
  Lets define the Lagrangian functional

  \begin{equation}
    J = D - \lambda\Big( \overline{R} - \frac{1}{B}\sum_{u=0}^{B-1}R(u) \Big)= \alpha \sum_{u=0}^{B-1} 2^{-2R(u)}\sigma_{S_u}^2 - \lambda \Big( \overline{R} - \frac{1}{B}\sum_{u=0}^{B-1}R(u) \Big),
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

which taking

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial R(u)} = 0
  \end{equation}

produces that

\begin{equation}
    R(u) = \frac{1}{2}\log_2\big( 2\alpha\ln 2\sigma_{S_u}^2 \big) - \frac{1}{2}\log_2\lambda.
    \tag{$R(u)$}
  \end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Substituting \(R(u)\) in Eq. (\(\overline{R}\)), we get that

  \begin{equation}
    \overline{R} = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{u=0}^{B-1}\frac{1}{2}\log_2\big( 2\alpha\ln 2\sigma_{S_u}^2 \big) - \frac{1}{2}\log_2\lambda.
  \end{equation}
\item
  Operating

  \begin{equation}
    \lambda = \prod_{u=0}^{B-1}\sqrt[B]{2\alpha\ln 2\sigma_{S_u}^2} - 2^{-2\overline{R}}.
  \end{equation}
\item
  Substituting \(\lambda\) in Eq. (\(R(u)\)), we obtain the optimal
  number of bits for each coeff

  \begin{equation}
    R(u) = \overline{R} + \frac{1}{2}\log_2\frac{\sigma_{S_u}^2}{\displaystyle\prod_{u=0}^{B-1}\sqrt[B]{\sigma_{S_u}^2}}.
  \end{equation}

  which minimizes the variance of the quantization error. Notice that
  this value depends proportionally on \(\overline{R}\) (the target
  average bits/coeff), logaritmically on \(\sigma_{S_u^2}\) (the
  variance of the coeff) and log-inversely on the geometric mean of the
  variances of all coeffs.
